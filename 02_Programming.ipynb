    "So you know the basics of individual instructions and that a program is just a series of instructions. But the real strength of programming isn't just running (or executing) one instruction after another. Based on how the expressions evaluate, the program can decide to skip instructions, repeat them, or choose one of several instructions to run. In fact, you almost never want your programs to start from the first line of code and simply execute every line, straight to the end. _Control flow statements_ can decide which Python instructions to execute under which conditions."
